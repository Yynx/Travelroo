  <h1>ITALY</h1>
  <break>
  <text>Italy, an European country with a long Mediterranean coastline, has left a powerful mark on Western culture and cuisine. Its capital, Rome, is home to the Vatican as well as landmark art and ancient ruins. Other major cities include Florence, with Renaissance masterpieces such as Michelangelo’s "David" and Brunelleschi's Duomo; Venice, the city of canals; and Milan, Italy’s fashion capital.</text>
</br>
</br>
  <text>Spectacular Italy needs almost no introduction and is one of the most popular travel destinations in Europe. Italy’s impact on the world can be seen all over the country, in the beautiful artwork, crumbling ruins, and impressive palaces and castles that dot the horizon.
As well as vibrant cities like Rome where old and new mingle seamlessly, you can also enjoy the less crowded coastal areas where you can relax on sandy beaches and swim in limpid seas. In addition to exploring Italy proper, you can also hop over to neighboring Sicily and enjoy a different side of life that also offers some of the best food and drink in the region.</text>

  <text> We've got 10 best things you can do in Italy!</text>
  <br/>
  <h1>1. Take to the waters of Lake Como</h1>
  <img src="Images/Lake-Como.jpg"/>
</br>
</br>
  <text>Lake Como in Lombardy spans an amazing 146 square kilometers and is the perfect place to get out on the water and explore Italy by boat.
The area around Lake Como has houses owned by some of the richest celebrities in the world, which tells you everything to know about the kind of views you can expect here.
The landscape surrounding the lake is covered with alpine forest and traditional villages as well as dainty ornate houses that make you feel as if you are in a picture postcard version of an Italian masterpiece.</text>
<h1>2. Stand on Juliet’s Balcony</h1>
<img src="Images/Balcony.jpg"/>
</br>
</br>
<text>Verona is home to what is said to be the balcony of Juliet, the character made famous in Shakespeare’s play Romeo and Juliet.
Unfortunately the reality is that the city of Verona bought the home featuring the balcony in 1905 with the purpose of making it into a tourist attraction and sadly the characters in Romeo and Juliet never existed in real life.
Still, the balcony is a pretty spot in the city and couples flock here to declare their love for each other beneath the famous building.</text>
<h1>3. Marvel at the Coliseum</h1>
<img src="Images/Coliseum.jpg"/>
</br>
</br>
<text>You can’t come to Rome and not visit one of the most famous attractions in the world, the mighty Coliseum.
The ruins of what was once a magnificent amphitheater are one of the greatest historical relics of our time and once it would have had a capacity of over 50,000 spectators.
The amphitheater is most well known for the gladiator matches that would have been showcased here and you can sit in the stands and imagine the violent spectacles that used to be performed here for the enjoyment of the crowds.</text>
<h1>4. Take a trip to Pompeii</h1>
<img src="Images/Pompeii.jpg"/>
</br>
</br>
<text>Pompeii is famous for the events that took place here in 79 AD, when Mount Vesuvius erupted and covered the town in ash.
The eruption meant that Roman life was captured and frozen in time, and when the site was excavated it offered a glimpse of a bygone era.
If you visit Pompeii today you can expect a kind of open air museum where you will find preserved houses, baths, and ancient Roman forums, all filled with the relics of the people who were living here when the eruption took place.</text>
<h1>5. Wander around the Historic Center of Siena</h1>
<img src="Images/Siena.jpg"/>
</br>
</br>
<text>The city of Siena is often overlooked in favor of Florence, although this is unfair as there is a huge amount to see and do here, and parts of the city are as pretty as its neighboring rival.
The Historic Center of Siena in particular is well worth a visit and starts at the Piazza del Campo which leads to a historic district that is covered with Gothic architecture that dates from the 12th century.
This mingles with buildings from the Middle Ages and signature points to look out for include the mighty Duomo, the Pinacoteca Nazionale, and the pretty Palazzo Salimbeni.</text> <br/>

<h1>6. Go on a pilgrimage to the Vatican</h1>
<img src="Images/Vatican.png"/>
</br>
</br>
<text>Vatican City is actually its own state within Italy, although you can only visit this landlocked area by first travelling to Rome.
If you are in the region then you should definitely consider swinging by one of the most important religious spots in the world, which is home to powerhouses such as the Piazza San Pietro and St Peter’s Basilica.
You can also take in the majesty of the Vatican Palace as well as the Sistine Chapel which features the Creation of Adam.</text>
<h1>7. Visit Saint Mark’s Basilica</h1>
<img src="Images/Basilica.jpg"/>
</br>
</br>
<text>Venice has a range of peerless attractions although perhaps the most famous of these is Saint Mark’s Basilica which sits on the famed Piazza San Marco or Saint Mark’s Square.
The basilica is the final resting place of Saint Mark the Evangelist and started life as a Byzantine church before being developed over the years.
The church is a work of art in its own right and you will find glittering mosaics and gorgeous marble decorations all over the complex as well as bas-reliefs and touches of gold leaf.</text>
<h1>8. Discover the Roman Forum</h1>
<img src="Images/Roman.jpg"/>
</br>
</br>
<text>The Roman Forum is another one of Italy’s big hitter attractions and lies between the Capitoline and the Palatine hills in Rome.
This would once have been the center of the mighty Roman Empire and you can take in the beautiful complex here as well as enjoy views from the terraces all over the wider city.</text>
<h1>8. Climb Stromboli</h1>
<img src="Images/Stromboli.jpg"/>
</br>
</br>
<text>On a visit to Sicily you absolutely can’t miss the chance to climb at least part way up Stromboli, a still active volcano.
If you are looking for an easy trek then you can walk 400 meters up the sides of Stromboli by yourself, although if you want to continue on to the crater which still billows clouds of ash and fire then you will need a certified guide to take you.
To get to the top takes around 3 hours with the descent coming in at around 2 hours, so all in all you need to allow a five to six hour trek in order to see everything.
It can be quite a slog to the top but it is well worth it for the spectacular views.</text>
<h1>9. Take a boat trip to the Blue Grotto</h1>
<img src="Images/Blue.jpg"/>
</br>
</br>
<text>One of the premium sights in Capri is the Blue Grotto, also known as the Grotta Azzurra.
The grotto is the result of a cavern which is filled with water that glows a luminescent blue when the sun hits it through shafts in the sides of the rock.
</text>
<h1>10. Take to the water at the Grand Canal</h1>
<img src="Images/Grand-Canal.jpg"/>
</br>
</br>
<text>The Grand Canal in Venice is one of the most famous waterways in the world and there are a variety of ways that you can enjoy it.
One of these is to take a water bus known as a vaporetto along the various parts of the canal where you can marvel at the little bridges and traditional Venetian homes that back onto the water.
Another more romantic way to travel around the canal is to take an iconic gondola ride where you can imagine that you are back in the Venice of a different time.<text>
The cavern itself rises to 14 meters in height in some parts and is around 60 meters long, and you can take in this amazing light show from a rowing boat inside the grotto which makes for one of the most memorable sightseeing experiences in all of Italy.</text>  <div>
