  <h1>Surfing The World</h1>
  <break>
  <h4>We think the best surf towns in the world, should not only be a location for the surfer who’s looking to prove themselves in more challenging waves, but should cater for the people who are just beginning to start out in the sport as well, whilst offering plenty of fun and exciting activities for those wanting a bit more from their surf holiday.</h4>
<br/>
  <h4>To give you a nudge in the right direction, we have listed 5 of the best surf towns in the world below, so have a read, add them to your surf holiday bucket list and start ticking them off!

  <h5> We've got 5 best surfing spots from around the world!</h5>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <h2>1. Canggu, Bali </h2>
  <br/>
  <img src="Bali.jpeg" alt="Bali Surf" width=50%>
  <br/>
  <text>Pronounced Changuu. A much less busy spot than Kuta, it is arguably the best place to stay in Bali. The main village is made up of three streets so its nice and small and has that laid back village vibe (hipster in a good way!) - full of cool cafés and chill out bars rather than the big nightclubs, commercial stores and resorts found in Kuta. The beach stretches for 8km and the surf here suits all levels, with Echo beach probably being the most well known. It is being developed fast so get there quick before its too late!</text>
  <text>April to September is a great time for advanced surfers as the swell is at it’s biggest during the dry season, for beginners head over in between October and March and for families we suggest March to June.</text>

  <h2>2. Santa Teresa, Costa Rica </h2>
  <br/>
  <img src="Costarica.jpeg" alt="Santa Teresa, Costa Rica Surf" width=50%>
  <br/>
  <text>Location: Santa Teresa is a small town in Puntarenas Province, West coast of Costa Rica.</text>
  <text>How to get there: Fly into Costa Rica’s capital, San Jose and you can get a connecting flight to Tambor whcih only takes 20 minutes. Tambor is 4 minutes from Santa Teresa.</text>
  <text>Why: Santa Teresa was a long hidden secret until the early 2000's. It has since grown into a perfect little surf town with delicious restaurants thanks to some ex-pat chefs leaving high pressure kitchens in big cities for a more chilled out pace of life. The roads are not fully opaved so it has that dusty beach feel. It has some of the best surf lodges and yoga retreats in Costa Rica. The beaches are for learning and intermediates. What we also love about Santa Teresa is its access to exploring...snorkelling in the crystal clear waters, hiking the numerous rainforest trails and visiting nearby villages like Mal Pais & Manzanillo.</text>
  <text>Best time to go: Anytime of the year but more advanced surfers should stick to April to October for the biggest surf. </text>

  <h2>3. Ericeira, Portugal </h2>
  <br/>

The area has 12 different surf beaches all within 8kms, each suiting different standards, from the stunning beginners beach Foz do Lizandro to the epic fast barrelling World Class Coxos.</text>
  <text>Best Time to go: July & August is peak time & great for families. June & September are great for beginners & intermediates as the summer crowds are gone. For advanced surfers go in October & November.</text>

      <h1>Surfing in Portugal!</h3>
        <small>Posted by Joanna Perks on August 16</small>
        <p>It was a lovely surprise that even in the Tourist Season, there were no other Surfers in the beach right in front of the surf camp, so we had a lot of space for practicing. The surfivor team was amazing and it was a great atmosphere in the Surfcamp. Surfing was amazing of course because those waves in Esmoriz are awesome. I also found the trips to Porto very nice, because it’s a beautiful town and the food there is just amazing. I’ll be back!</P>
