        <h3>Canggu, Bali</h3>
        <p>Pronounced Changuu. A much less busy spot than Kuta, it is arguably the best place to stay in Bali. The main village is made up of three streets so its nice and small and has that laid back village vibe (hipster in a good way!) - full of cool cafés and chill out bars rather than the big nightclubs, commercial stores and resorts found in Kuta. The beach stretches for 8km and the surf here suits all levels, with Echo beach probably being the most well known. It is being developed fast so get there quick before its too late!</p>

        <h3>Santa Teresa, Costa Rica</h3>
        <p>Location: Santa Teresa is a small town in Puntarenas Province, West coast of Costa Rica.How to get there: Fly into Costa Rica’s capital, San Jose and you can get a connecting flight to Tambor whcih only takes 20 minutes. Tambor is 4 minutes from Santa Teresa. Santa Teresa was a long hidden secret until the early 2000's. It has since grown into a perfect little surf town with delicious restaurants thanks to some ex-pat chefs leaving high pressure kitchens in big cities for a more chilled out pace of life. The roads are not fully opaved so it has that dusty beach feel. It has some of the best surf lodges and yoga retreats in Costa Rica. The beaches are for learning and intermediates. What we also love about Santa Teresa is its access to exploring...snorkelling in the crystal clear waters, hiking the numerous rainforest trails and visiting nearby villages like Mal Pais & Manzanillo. Best time to go: Anytime of the year but more advanced surfers should stick to April to October for the biggest surf.

      <h1>Surfing in Portugal!</h3>
        <small>Posted by Joanna Perks on August 16</small>
        <p>It was a lovely surprise that even in the Tourist Season, there were no other Surfers in the beach right in front of the surf camp, so we had a lot of space for practicing. The surfivor team was amazing and it was a great atmosphere in the Surfcamp. Surfing was amazing of course because those waves in Esmoriz are awesome. I also found the trips to Porto very nice, because it’s a beautiful town and the food there is just amazing. I’ll be back!</P>

      <h1>The Philippines!!!</h3>
        <small>Posted by Sam Davies on Septemeber 6</small>
        <p>For me, as a surfer, it was a highly anticipated stop during my travels in South East Asia and I’m super stoked to say it didn’t disappoint, in fact, it was even more incredible than I imagined. I chose to base myself in the General Luna area as it has easy access to a variety of waves, a good selection of accommodation, beginner surf camps and a good choice of places to eat too. Although a lot of the waves are the perfect playground for intermediate – advanced surfers there’s also some option for those looking to learn to surf too.</P>

      <h1>THULUSDHOO ISLAND Maldives</h3>
        <small>Posted by Laura Dennis on October 12</small>
        <p>If you surf, love the ocean or simply want to kick back on a stunning Maldives island Thulusdhoo is certainly somewhere you should consider! The cheapest way of getting to Thulusdhoo is the local ferry from Male. Peak surf season on Thulusdhoo is June to August, but the best weather is January to March!</P>

      <h1>SURFING IN BYRON BAY</h3>
        <small>Posted by Jim Suzuki on August 16</small>
        <p>Byron Bay is a hippy coastal town soaked in the alternative lifestyle. An eccentric nudist community, Nimbin, is just a short ride outside of town and every third backpacker you meet sports a wetsuit sunburn and sun-bleached dreads. The vibe is fun, laid-back, and it turned out to be the perfect backdrop to my painstaking hours of surf lessons. The Mojo Surf van pulled up in front of my hostel and within minutes the ten of us were cruising a coastal road parallel to the rolling ocean waters. I used Mojo Surf after endlessly researching my options. I needed a budget option with good reviews, and they fit the bill nicely.I stayed at the Arts Factory Lodge in the dorms and it was a good spot from which to explore the city — basic but clean and has a great traveler vibe. If I return as a couple, I would likely stay in the Bayshore Bungalows, which are mid-range prices and more private than the hostels. Although I had packed a short-sleeved rash-guard, our instructors also passed out full-sleeved rashies that would protect our arms from both sun and potential sand-burns on our skin. The sun in Australia is even stronger than my hometown</P>

      <h1>Surfing North Devon...</h3>
        <small>Posted by Brenden Smith on November 1</small>
        <p>believe it or not the UK has some pretty damn epic surf and whilst I’ve been home I’ve been lucky enough to score some good pre winter swells at my semi home break of Putsborough in North Devon. Waves shared with good friends and even a splash of sunshine.</P>

      <h3>Morocco Waves</h3>
        <small>Posted by Joanna Perks on August 16</small>
        <p>Anchor Point, with its sand and reef breaks is one of the most sought-after surfing spots in Taghazout. It’s possible on a good day to ride the waves for almost a kilometer. Other popular surf spots in the area include Hash Point, with its right-side waves, Killer Point, Mysteries, and Panorama. The small town of Tamri is around a 30-minute drive to the north of Taghazout. Easily accessed from the larger surfing destination for a day of fun on the waves, the main area is a good place for surfing when other places along the coast are flat. It offers good surfing for people of all experience levels. Tiguert is between Taghazout and Tamri. The tricky reef break at Unicorns’ is usually quiet. Boilers, where you can see the remains of a shipwreck at the start of the wave, is a busier surfing area, thanks to the consistent waves. Draculas’ is a large break, located near the light house. Desert Point is often said to be among the premier surf spots in the whole country.</P>
